# ScoreKeeperApp
trial by combat cum scorekeeper . This is 2nd project in Android Scholarship . We need to build a score keeper app, can select any sport or game to track. The chosen game can have multiple important metrics to track, such as fouls, outs, and innings.

I have tried making a game to track scores and shorts and progress bar to show the health.
